 ## Landscape: ##

GBST is operating in the wealth management and capital markets space, the industry as a whole has undergone a major shift towards cloud based services and increased usage of digital solutions. 
Cloud revolution has been a massive growing trend in terms of data storage and accessibility while helping organisations lower their entry cost and speed time to solution. Over 90% of data storage was held in local severs and cloud storage has taken over more than 30% in 2019. *A Decade of Change: How Tech Evolved in the 2010s and What’s In Store for the 2020s (Pedro Palandrani, Andrew Little 2011)* Compared to the traditional in house servers, which is costly and inefficient, cloud based technology allows companies like GBST to host their platform and store consumer data in the cloud (Amazon Web Service) which can be accessed anywhere, anytime. 
	
Digital transformation has also changed the way companies in this domain manage their daily functions such as client acquisition, research and portfolio management, investment customisation and client engagement. Distribution of products and services historically involved multiple intermediaries which has proven to be time consuming and costly, but with the help Digitalisation has helped disrupt processes and business models, allowing companies to reduce cost, improve efficiencies and reach their end clients directly with the help of Fintech powered digital marketplace and Robo-advisers. It has also opened doors for wealth managers who now have easier access to global investment opportunities.

With the rapid development of digital technology, the threat of cybercrime has become a growing concern for many online users. According to Deloitte’s technology research paper in 2010, cybercrime has accumulated $1trillion in annual revenue, putting them well ahead of drug trafficking as the largest illicit global business. *Depth perception A dozen technology trends shaping business and IT in 2010 (Deloite 2010)*
Cybersecurity ventures predicted that global cyber security spending has been growing at a constant pace from $3.5 billion in 2004 to $202 billion in 2022. This is a reflection that companies are prioritising digital security to protect their customers.

 ## Results: ##

  
 For companies employing GBST’s solutions, the impact on their business has been largely positive as they have seen increase profitability by automating mid to back office post settlement administration. Their technology solution has simplified a complicated and labour intensive process and at the same time significantly reduced business compliance risk, essentially reducing regulatory cost. This is particularly important since the implementation of Haynes 2017 Royal commission which investigated misconducts in the financial sector, resulting in major banks and financial advisers to increase their spending to monitor risk and compliance. GBST's solutions are constantly updated according to the Australian financial regulatory requirement, allowing their clients to remain compliant while minimising compliant cost.  

 to measure success in the wealth managment industry, companies often use various Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to compare with their competitors and themsevles to see how their company is tracking. some KPI includes Asset Under Management (AUM), client acquisition and retention, profit margin, revenue per client and management fee as a percentage of AUM.

> - AUM: it is not publicised of what GBST's overall AUM is, but in 2020, their Composer platform asset under management grew by 12% to just over EUR$150 billion in the UK as part of their strategic global expansion into the UK market. At the same time, they grew their active accounts by 8% to reach 3.2 million users in the year ended December 2020.

> - Annual revenue is a good indication to track a company’s growth rate from its previous years and to compare with competitors of similar size.
	
Compared to Avaloq, GBST's AUM seems insignificant. But it is crucial to note that Avaloq is a larger scale company, employing more than 2,000 people compared to the 300 workers GBST employs. In terms of company size, GBST is much more similar to JMR Software and Profile Software and is outperforming both companies as their annual revenue sits at about $90M compared to JMR’s $20M and Profile Software’s $23.52M


 ## Recommendations: ##


In order to keep up to date with the ever growing financial world and the increase in adoption of cryptocurrency, it is recommended that GBST incorporate crypto asset and blockchain solutions into their offerings.  Reason being that cryptocurrency and blockchain is a disruptive technology which has not been widely adopted yet, and it would be beneficial for GBST to stay in the forefront as one of the leading companies to offer cryptocurrency capabilities to their clients. Although there is scepticism around this technology, it is gradually being incorporated into the finance sector, especially bitcoin. Major companies such as Microsoft and Paypal have recently announced that they will accept bitcoin and Visa has approved the first Australian card for spending bitcoin. El Salvador has even adopted bitcoin as legal tender in June 2021. This additional offering will involve the incorporation of blockchain technology into their platform. Cryptocurrency can also provide diversity to client portfolios as it is slowly being adopted as an alternate investment class.
